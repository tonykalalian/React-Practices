## Introduction
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and CodeSandbox is an excellent online development environment that makes it easy to experiment with React without any setup. This repository serves as a playground for me to practice various React concepts, such as:

### Creating components
### Managing state and props
### Routing with React Router
### Using hooks like useState and useEffect
### Fetching data from APIs
### Styling with CSS-in-JS and CSS modules
